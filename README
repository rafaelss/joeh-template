Joeh-Template is a fast template engine for PHP5, using pure PHP syntax, and generating PHP compatible code for all PHP installations.
The main idea is just let developers to use PHP inside templates, but without let that developers write ugly code, difficulting manutenability.

Functionalities:

1 - PHP tags must close in same line that were opened:

  good:
  <? if($var) { ?>
    <p>that's ok</p>
  <? } ?>

  bad:
  <?
  if($var) {
    ?>
    <p>oopss, wrong syntax</p>
    <?
  }
  ?>

2 - Short PHP tags will be replaced for long tags in compiled code, for compability purposes

  from:
  <? if($var) { ?>
    <?= $var ?>
  <? } ?>

  to:
  <?php if($var) { ?>
    <? echo $var ?>
  <?php } ?>
