This project provide a fast template engine for PHP5, using pure PHP code as syntax, but with some limitations (for programmer):

1 - PHP tags must close in same line that were opened:

  good:
  <? if($var) { ?>
    <p>that's ok</p>
  <? } ?>

  bad:
  <?
  if($var) {
    ?>
    <p>oopss, syntax error</p>
    <?
  }
  ?>

2 - PHP functions cannot be called directly, all permited functions are provided by helpers, these helpers can be
    in core of framework, or created by users (kind of Smarty tags)

  <?= $string->replace("_", "-", "joeh_template") ?>

3 - Short PHP tags will be replaced for long tags in compiled code, for compability purposes

  from:
  <? if($var) { ?>
    <?= $var ?>
  <? } ?>

  to:
  <?php if($var) { ?>
    <? echo $var ?>
  <?php } ?>
